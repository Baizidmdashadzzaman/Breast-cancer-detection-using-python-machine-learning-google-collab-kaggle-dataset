#Here diagnosis = M means Malignant indicate cancer cell & B not
from google.colab import files # Use to load data on Google Colab
uploaded = files.upload() # Use to load data on Google Colab

#count the number of row and col in data set
df.shape

#count the number of empty value in each col (NaN,NAN.na)
df.isna().sum()

#drop the col with all missing values / empty
df = df.dropna(axis=1)

# get the new count the number of row and col in data set
df.shape

# get the count of number of malignant (M) or benign(B) cells
df['diagnosis'].value_counts()

# now visualize the data of diagnosis
sns.countplot(df['diagnosis'], label='count data')
